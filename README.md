* HandSpeak is a project focused on developing a hand gesture recognition system to improve communication for deaf and mute individuals.
* There are an estimated 466 million people worldwide who are deaf or hard of hearing, and over 70 million who are mute or have difficulty speaking.
* Sign language is often the primary means of communication for these individuals, but it can be challenging to communicate effectively with non-signers.
* HandSpeak uses advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze video or image input from a camera or other device.
* The system is capable of recognizing and interpreting the various hand gestures used in sign language with an accuracy rate of over 95% in early trials.
* HandSpeak has significant potential to help millions of people communicate more effectively, making it an exciting and promising project in the field of assistive technology.
